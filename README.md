These tests exercise RIOT's CoAP implementations, [gcoap and nanocoap](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/wiki/CoAP-Home). The tests are automated with the use of [pytest](https://pytest.org/).

With all of these tests, your confidence in the results will increase by watching the CoAP messages in Wireshark.

These tests all were developed using native on a recent Ubuntu Linux. Tests that use the gcoap example may be run on real hardware. See the _Setup_ section below for information on the required environment variables.

Materials
=========

In addition to pytest, you'll need a recent copy of these projects:

|  Project  | Notes |
| --------- | ----- |
| [aiocoap](https://github.com/chrysn/aiocoap) | must install linkheader Python package; see the *Slimmer installations* portion of aiocoap docs |
| [libcoap](https://github.com/obgm/libcoap) | |
| [soscoap](https://github.com/kb2ma/soscoap) | |
[riot-apps](https://github.com/kb2ma/riot-apps) | forked from RIOT-OS/applications; use kb2ma-master branch |

The _Setup_ section below assumes these projects are installed in source code form, not with pip or setup.py.

RIOT Tools
----------
These tests use the following RIOT based tools, which must be precompiled:

|       Tool      |   Location | Notes |
| --------------- | ---------- | ----- |
| gcoap           | examples   |       |
| nanocoap_server | examples   |       |
| cord_ep         | examples   |       |
| cord_epsim      | examples   | when compile for native2os endpoints, must specify RD_ADDR as TAP_LLADDR_REMOTE from `setup_env.sh`; otherwise aiocoap fails with the default multicast address on local |
| nanocoap_cli    | tests      |       |
| gcoap-block     | riot-apps  |       |


Setup
=====
The network/board interfaces used for tests have evolved over time. The table below show the currently supported setups.


|       Test       |     Endpoints      |      SUT        |  Tools  | Notes |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | --------------- | ------- | ----- |
| block1           | native2os          | nanocoap_server | aiocoap | Must run only test_block1_buf for now |
| block1           | native2native      | gcoap-block     | aiocoap | gcoap-block uses code not merged yet into RIOT master |
| block2           | native2os          | nanocoap_server | aiocoap | |
| con_retry        | native2os          | gcoap           | aiocoap | |
| cord_ep          | native2os, slip2os | cord_ep (gcoap) | aiocoap | |
| cord_epsim       | native2os, slip2os | cord_epsim (gcoap) | aiocoap, libcoap | |
| observe          | native2os, slip2os | gcoap           | aiocoap | |
| request_response | native2os          | nanocoap_cli, gcoap | libcoap, aiocoap | |
| request_response | slip2os            | gcoap           | libcoap, aiocoap | Must run gcoap tests one by one to avoid running the nanocoap test. |

Each test named above is implemented in the file **[name]_test.py**.

native2os
---------
Some of these tests use a tap interface to communicate between a native RIOT instance and the Linux desktop. They require an fd00:bbbb::/64 ULA-based network defined on the desktop as:
```
    $ sudo ip address add fd00:bbbb::1/64 dev tap0 scope global
```

Some tests do not allow specification of the address, so the test uses the TAP_LLADDR_SUT environment variable for the link local address for the RIOT endpoint, and TAP_LLADR_REMOTE for the address of the OS endopint. You can specify a link local address for tap with:
```
    sudo ip link set dev tap0 address 0:0:bb:bb:0:1
    sudo ip address add fe80::200:bbff:febb:1/64 dev tap0 scope link
```
Notice the REMOTE tap interface address uses host '1', while the SUT address for the RIOT board must use host '2'.

Some tests require environment variables. See `setup_env.sh`. You MUST adapt it to the paths on your machine, but then you can source it with:
```
    $ . setup_env.sh
```
As mentioned in the _Materials_ section, presently the script is based on installation of aiocoap and libcoap in source form.

native2native
-------------
Some tests use a tap bridge to communicate between two RIOT instances. In this case the tests always use the link local network addresses generated by the OS. The tap bridge is setup with:

```
    $ cd $RIOTBASE/dist/tools/tapsetup/
    $ ./tapsetup -c 2

    # to delete the tap
    $ ./tapsetup -d
```

slip2os
-------
Some tests allow use of a physical board for the RIOT instance. They require an fd00:bbbb::/64 ULA-based network defined on the desktop as:

```
    $ cd $RIOTBASE/dist/tools/tunslip/
    $ sudo ./tunslip6 -s ttyUSB0 -t tun0 fd00:bbbb::1/64
```

rpl2os
------
This setup allows use of a physical board via RPL to a Linux host. This setup requires two boards:

  * RPL root node attached to the Linux host, running the gnrc_border_router example
  * RPL leaf node running gcoap/nanocoap

**RPL root node**

The _make term_ step below initializes addressing and routing on the Linux host before starting the terminal.

For this node, we specify the address of the wireless interface on the fd00:aaaa::/64 network. Then we initialize the node as RPL root.

```
    $ BOARD="samr21-xpro" make clean all flash
    $ BOARD="samr21-xpro" IPV6_PREFIX="fd00:aaaa::/64" PORT="/dev/ttyACM0" make term
    
    > ifconfig 6 add unicast fd00:aaaa::1/64
    > rpl init 6
    > rpl root 1 fd00:aaaa::1
```


**RPL leaf node**

After setting up the RPL root node, just initialize rpl for the leaf node.

```
    $ BOARD="samr21-xpro" make clean all flash
    $ BOARD="samr21-xpro" PORT="/dev/ttyACM1" make term

    > rpl init 6
```
